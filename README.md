This repository is a collection of code and some results of the code on using FNNs and DeepONet to model differential equations. The advection diffusion equation is used here for the code and results.

Code:
fnn.py is the FNN model for differential equation modeling
deeponet.py is the first attempt at using DeepONet to model differential equations
deeponet-alt.py is the second attempt, which is successful
sensitivity.py is a program that performs sensitivity analysis by inputting slightly different initial conditions.
